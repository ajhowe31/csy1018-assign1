After my css passed at level 3, i removed the styling and the link in the img provided by w3 and placed my own styling in the css file, and removed the 'a href' link as the assignment brief states that no img should contain a link. However if link is kept it allows viewers of your site to click the image and be taken to w3s site to show your code has genuinely been validated.-->
